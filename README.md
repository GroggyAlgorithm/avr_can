# avr_can
Object oriented canbus library for Atmel AVR CPUs used with the Arduino IDE.


<<<<<<< HEAD
This library supports the built in CAN hardware in some Atmet AVR chips.  It was ported from the existing due_can library and follows those APIs.  In this way applications within the Arduino IDE can be more universally written changing only the underlying library.

Example CPU chips which are supported include:
* ATmega16M1, ATmega32M1, ATmega64M1
* ATmega32C1, ATmega64C1
* AT90CAN32, AT90CAN64, AT90CAN128

Note:  To date only limited testing has been performed using the ATmega64M1 controller.

Reference:  This is a porting of the CAN_DUE library at:

=======
This is a place holder for a potential porting of the due_can lib:
  (https://github.com/collin80/due_can)
  
  to support Atmel AVR CPUs which feature a built in CAN module.  
  Primary target is: ATmega32M1, ATmega64M1 -  With potential support for other CPUs, such as the AT90CAN...
