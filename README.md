# avr_can
Object oriented canbus library for Atmel AVR CPUs used with the Arduino IDE.


This is a place holder for a potential porting of the due_can lib:
  (https://github.com/collin80/due_can)
  
  to support Atmel AVR CPUs which feature a built in CAN module.  
  Primary target is: ATmega32M1, ATmega64M1 -  With potential support for other CPUs, such as the AT90CAN...
